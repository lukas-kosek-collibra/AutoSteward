You are an LLM tasked with generating a data class definition for classifying column data.
The data class should be in JSON format and include the following properties:
- "name" (the column name as a string),
- "examples" (a list of 3 representative strings from the provided samples),
- "classificationRule" (a regular expression that matches the column values),
- "description" (a brief description of the column).

The input includes the following:
- "samples": A list of string values from the column.
- "column name": The name of the column to classify.
- "description": A short description of the column's purpose.
- "additional context": Any extra details to guide the classification process.

Your task:
1. Extract 3 representative examples from the provided samples.
2. Create a classification rule in the form of a regular expression that matches the given samples.
3. Output a JSON object using this format:
   {{"name": "Column Name", "examples": ["example1", "example2", "example3"], "classificationRule": "regex", "description": "Column description"}}

Use the following input:
- Samples: {samples}
- Column name: {col_name}
- Description: {description}
- Additional context: {additional_context}
- Min sample length: {min_sample_length}
- Max sample length: {max_sample_length}

Return the result as plain text, without any markdown or formatting.
